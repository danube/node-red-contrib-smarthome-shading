# What this node does
Control your shading and blinds with the help of this node. Connect window switches and push buttons. Configure automatic movement and security measures.

# Getting started
There are only a few parameters, which you can set to every node individually. Most parameters are collected in a parameter set called "shading configuration". You can create multiple such shading configuration sets and then assign various shading nodes.

## Warning and error codes
Warnings and errors will be sent both to the integrated Node-RED debugger and the terminal, so it may be a good idea to have focus to at least one of them. If a warning or an error happens, it will be sent to there with a leading identifier. This starts either with "W" for warnings or "E" for errors. Example: "E007: Invalid James Bond detected, replace!".
