# Warnings (Wxxx)
| Code | Short title | Long description |
|-|-|-|
| W001 | Cannot restore sensor states | During operation, the node receives sensor states and stores them in the local memory. This local memory gets lost, if the node (or Node-RED) restarts. Then, the previous sensor states are unknown. To solve this, Node-RED has introduced the context store option "localfilesystem". With this ability, the store will be permanently written into a file on your system. On a restart, this file the will be loaded. [Learn here, how to enable the option](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/context#saving-context-data-to-the-file-system). |
| W002 | Received invalid drive position '`msg.payload`'. | Your drive sent an actual position value. The value in percent must be between 0 (open/up) and 100 (closed/down), but the received value was not within this range. The received value will be shown in the message as `msg.payload`. |
| W003 | Undefined hardlock variable at '`location.variable`'. | The hardlock variable must be available either as flow or global variable in your context data. So you must set it somewhere, before this node will be called. If the configured variable is unavailable, you will see this warning. Further, **the node assumes an active hardlock**. Optionally, disable the hardlock option in the configuration. |
| W004 | Hard lock variable not a boolean | Good news: Your configured hardlock variable can be found either as flow or global one. Bad news: It's value is neither `true` nor `false`. Check and fix that. Until then, **the node assumes an active hardlock**. Optionally, disable the hardlock option in the configuration. |
| W005 | Unknown actual position, but rising is allowed. | You have configured, that the node expects a position feedback from the drive (node setting: "Height feedback topic"). No such position feedback has been received yet. Now, the drive should go to open position (0%). From safety view, this is okay, but you will receive this message, until a valid position feedback message has been received or the node setting is changed to "Disabled". |
| W006 | Unknown actual position. Nothing will happen. | You have configured, that the node expects a position feedback from the drive (node setting: "Height feedback topic"). No such position feedback has been received yet. Now, the drive should go to some position, which is not the open position (something above 0%). From safety view, according to the node settings, this may be disallowed, as it may be possible that the shading moves down (we do not know, as we have no actual position). Hence, nothing will happen. You will receive this message, until a valid position feedback message has been received or the node setting is changed to "Disabled". |
| W007 | Unknown actual position | You have configured, that the node expects a position feedback from the drive (node setting: "Height feedback topic"). No such position feedback has been received yet. Security settings do not disallow movement in any condition, so the drive will move. You will receive this message, until a valid position feedback message has been received or the node setting is changed to "Disabled". |
| W008 | Unknown or invalid window State. Nothing will happen. | You have a window switch configured. To be able to operate the drive properly, the switch state must be present and valid. Until then, for security reason, the drive will only move up, but not down. You will receive this message, until a valid window switch position has been received or the setting "Window switch enable" is unchecked. |
# Errors (Exxx)
| Code | Short title | Long description |
|-|-|-|
| E001 | invalid setposHeight type ('type') [caller] | Height setpoint must be of type `number`. For some reason, that's not the case (see `'type'` for the type received). Please consult the developer. |
| E002 | negative setposHeight ('value') [caller] | Height setpoint must be bigger than zero. For some reason, that's not the case (see `'value'` for the value received). Please consult the developer. |
| E003 | setposHeight above 100 ('value') [caller] | Height setpoint must be below 100. For some reason, that's not the case (see `'value'` for the value received). Please consult the developer. |
| E004 | Suntimes calculator broken | 3rd party library [suncalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc) is loaded to calculate sun related values. This function did not provide valid values. Please consult the developer. |
| E005 | Undefined hardlock type | Hardlock type is defined in the node configuration via dropdown and can be either "Disabled", "Flow" or "Global". This error appears, if the setting holds another value (which should not be possible). Please consult the developer. |
| E006 | Cannot find valid sunrise or sunset times | 3rd party library [suncalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/suncalc) is loaded to calculate sunrise and sunset times. This function did not provide valid values. Please consult the developer. |
| E007 | Setpoint in message must be between 0-100 (but is 'value') | With the position command "Height position" you send a destination position to the node. `msg.payload` must be a number between 0-100 (%), but the value you sent is not in that range. The value received will be printed in parentheses. |
| E008 | Setpoint in message must be of type 'number' (but is 'type') | With the position command "Height position" you send a destination position to the node. `msg.payload` must be a number between 0-100 (%), but the datatype you sent is not 'number'. The type received will be printed in parentheses. |
