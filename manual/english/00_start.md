# Getting started
// TODO this node contains a node confir and a config set config.
## Properties
### Name
If unset, the node shows "Shading" on the drawboard. If you give it any value here, the node will be shown with this string.
### Configuration
Use the dropdown to either select one of the already composed configuration sets or create a new one.
- // TODO new: [Learn here about the configuration set parameters](configuration.md)
### Debugging
If enabled, additional messages will be printed in the Node-RED Log and the debugging console of the web UI.
## Warning and error codes
Warnings and errors will be sent both to the integrated Node-RED debugger and the terminal, so it may be a good idea to have focus to at least one of them. If a warning or an error happens, it will be sent to there with a leading identifier. This starts either with "W" for warnings or "E" for errors. Example: "E007: Invalid James Bond detected, replace!".
